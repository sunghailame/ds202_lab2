## Question set (individual)

Coordinate with your teammate and decide among you who is Individual 1 and Individual 2, respectively. Each of you should create an RMarkdown file either named `individual1.Rmd` or `individual2.Rmd` to include the answers.

**For each of the questions below provide at least one graphic as a basis for your answer.**

1. How are ratings distributed? Don't forget to mention outliers, if there are any.
- The rating is normally concentrated on 2.5 to 3.5. 
```{r}
choco <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lbchu/ds202_labs/master/choco.csv")
hist(choco$Rating)
```

2. Do ratings depend on the cacao percentage of a chocolate bar? 
3. What class is the variable representing company locations? How is this different from a 'character' variable? (You do not need to produce a graphic for this question.)
